# 🧠 OOP Assignment - Superhero & Polymorphism

This is a basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project written in Python. It includes two parts:

## 🔹 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class

We create a `Superhero` class with encapsulated attributes and two subclasses:
- `FlyingHero`
- `TechHero`

Each subclass overrides the `fight()` method to demonstrate **polymorphism** and **inheritance**.

### ✅ Features:
- Encapsulation using private attributes
- Constructors to initialize superhero data
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Display and fight methods

## 🔹 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

We define a base `Vehicle` class and create different types of vehicles:
- `Car` 🚗
- `Plane` ✈️
- `Boat` 🚢

Each subclass implements its own version of the `move()` method to demonstrate **polymorphism**.
